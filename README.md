# Brownian Motion Simulation

The idea behind this project is to create a simulation of the well known phenomena of random movement of a body inside a fluid, explained in 1905 by Albert Einstein as Brownian Motion

In principal there are a number of small molecule that move around the fluid with 3 degrees of freedom (two in this case), colliding together and with the main body, which seams to move randomly, but its motion can be precisely predicted from the existence of this small particles.

This pattern of motion typically consists of random fluctuations in a particle's position inside a fluid sub-domain, followed by a relocation to another sub-domain. Each relocation is followed by more fluctuations within the new closed volume. This pattern describes a fluid at thermal equilibrium, defined by a given temperature. Within such a fluid, there exists no preferential direction of flow (as in transport phenomena). More specifically, the fluid's overall linear and angular momenta remain null over time. The kinetic energies of the molecular Brownian motions, together with those of molecular rotations and vibrations, sum up to the caloric component of a fluid's internal energy (the equipartition theorem).

The collision in this model are assumed to be completely elastic, therefore following these system of equations for the transformation of the velocities.

This had been the first theoretical proof of the existence of atoms.
