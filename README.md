<h1>Brownian Motion Simulation<\h1>
<p>The idea behind this project is to creat a simulation of the well known phenomena of random movement of a body inside a fluid, explained in 1905 by Alber Einsten as Brownian Motion<p>

<p>In principal there are a number of small molecule that move around the fluid with 3 degrees of freedom (two in this case), colliding together and with the main body, which seams to move randomly, but its motion can be precisely predicted from the existence of this small particles.<p>

<p>This had been the first theoretical proove of the existence of atoms.<p>
